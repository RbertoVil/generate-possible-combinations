# Generate all possible combinations

This program has the *objetive of find all possible combinations* of sentences
in a truth table, which could be very helpfull at propositional logic.

I wrote this program at November 20 of 2020, because actually i'm studying
computer science and a teacher of **"discrete mathematics"** ask me to create a
truth table of propositional logic with 6 sentences.

According to the formula "2^n" when "n" are the number of sentences, the truth
table of that 6 sentences have a total of 64 possible combinations. The
process of looking for a combinations a compare with all that at the moment is in the
table bored me, but I love code.

So I wrote this program for that reason, actually I just know *Python*, but in
the future I want to write the same program in diferents languages such as
Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, etc.
